No Duplicates as well will be there is the sorted range


Algorithm thinking
arr[] = {2,4,6,7,9,10,11,23,45,446}
        {0 1 2 3 4 5  6  7  8   9} INDEXING

===1st===
low = 0
high = arr.length - 1;
mid = low + high / 2;
===TO-Do===
target = 55
update low, high and mid depending on the target
===CHECK===
arr[mid] = 9 == target = 55 ? FALSE
high = 9 < low = 0 ? FALSE
arr[mid] = 9 < target = 55 ? FALSE
===UPDATE===
